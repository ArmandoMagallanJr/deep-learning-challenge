# Alphabet Soup 

## Neural Network Model Analysis Report

Overview:

Alphabet Soup is in need of a model that can help it select applicants for funding with the best chance of success. Based on the data provided by Alphabet Soup, we have been able to create a tool that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.


Summary:

While the accuracy achieved meets a basic level of performance accuracy greater than 75%, there could be room for improvement. We could conduct a more in-depth analysis of the dataset to identify any data patterns or correlations. Finding the best model and approach may require further experimentation.
